# Sentiment-Score

## Phase 1 - Score Calculation

**Setup:** 
1. Copy the *googletrans folder* and *gibberish-detector model* to a folder and save it in drive. 
2. Open the notebook *sentiment_score.ipynb* in google colab.
3. Set the path of the folder from **step 1** in the *cd* command in the notebook (cell 3).
4. Run all the cells to get the sentiment score of the app.

Running all the cells will generate the sentiment score and prepare the processed data for the dashboard. To save the processed data, uncomment the last cell.

## Phase 2 - Labelling Data

Run all the cells in *Data_Labeller.ipynb* after updating the path of the trained classifier. Use the file obtained from phase 1 for labelling purposes.
